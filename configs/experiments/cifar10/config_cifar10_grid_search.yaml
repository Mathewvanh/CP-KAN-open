# Configuration for KAN vs MLP Comparison on CIFAR-10

experiment_name: "CIFAR10_GridSearch_KAN_MLP" # Updated name
random_seed: 42
num_epochs: 50 # Correct epochs
results_dir: "results/cifar10_grid_search" # Updated results dir

dataset:
  name: "cifar10"
  task_type: "classification"
  data_path: "./data" # Path where torchvision will download/look for CIFAR-10
  primary_metric: "accuracy" # Default for classification
  num_classes: 10 # Explicitly add num_classes

# Define methods and grids for the grid search
methods_to_run: ['FixedKAN', 'MLP'] # Added MLP

# Renamed parameter_grid to parameter_grids
parameter_grids: 
  FixedKAN: # Using CP-KAN (QUBO) grid from Appendix E, Table 10
    default:
      hidden_size: [ [64], [128], [32, 32] ] # Reverted to hidden_size list
      max_degree: [3, 5, 7]
      learning_rate: [0.001, 0.0003, 0.0001]
      # Fixed params from Table 10 for QUBO/IP/Evo/Greedy
      default_hidden_degree: [3]
      complexity_weight: [0.01]
      trainable_coefficients: [True]
      skip_qubo_hidden: [False] # Assuming default behavior

  MLP: # Adapted from Jane Street MLP grid (Appendix C, Table 6)
    default:
      mlp_hidden_layers: [ [20, 20], [20, 20, 20], [20, 20, 20, 20], # Reverted to mlp_hidden_layers
                         [24, 24], [24, 24, 24], [24, 24, 24, 24], # Reverted to mlp_hidden_layers
                         [28, 28], [28, 28, 28], [28, 28, 28, 28] ] # Reverted to mlp_hidden_layers
      mlp_dropout: [0.1, 0.15]
      learning_rate: [0.01, 0.005]
      mlp_activation: ['ReLU'] # Assuming default

# Removed original parameter_grid structure
# Removed KAN optimization methods comparison section

# Added training section
training:
  batch_size: 64 # From Appendix C.4
  optimizer: "AdamW" # Common default
  loss_function: "CrossEntropyLoss" # Standard for classification
  device: "auto"
